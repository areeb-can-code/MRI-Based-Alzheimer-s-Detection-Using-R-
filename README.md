# Alzheimer's and Dementia Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop predictive models for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease and dementia using data science techniques. By leveraging MRI datasets and applying advanced statistical analysis techniques, the goal is to create accurate models that can distinguish between affected individuals and healthy subjects.

## Project Description
Alzheimer's disease and dementia pose significant challenges to public health, with early detection playing a crucial role in providing timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on leveraging data science methodologies to develop predictive models capable of identifying signs of Alzheimer's and dementia based on MRI data.
